# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for the Rancher System Upgrade Controller to the Kite Kubernetes management interface, similar to the existing Tailscale integration. The System Upgrade Controller is a Kubernetes-native approach to node upgrades that uses custom resources to define and manage upgrade plans. This integration will provide a visual interface for managing system upgrades, monitoring upgrade progress, and configuring upgrade plans through the Kite web UI.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want to view the status of the System Upgrade Controller installation, so that I can verify it's properly deployed and operational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the System Upgrade Controller page THEN the system SHALL display the installation status
2. IF the System Upgrade Controller is not installed THEN the system SHALL show installation instructions and documentation links
3. WHEN the System Upgrade Controller is installed THEN the system SHALL display the version and available workload types
4. WHEN checking installation status THEN the system SHALL verify the presence of required CRDs (plans.upgrade.cattle.io)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want to manage upgrade plans through the web interface, so that I can create, view, edit, and delete system upgrade configurations without using kubectl.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the upgrade plans list THEN the system SHALL display all existing upgrade plans with their status
2. WHEN the user creates a new upgrade plan THEN the system SHALL provide a form with all necessary configuration options
3. WHEN the user edits an existing upgrade plan THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the form with current values
4. WHEN the user deletes an upgrade plan THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation and remove the resource
5. WHEN displaying upgrade plans THEN the system SHALL show plan name, target nodes, upgrade image, and current status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want to monitor upgrade progress and status, so that I can track the success and failure of system upgrades across my cluster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upgrade is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time status updates
2. WHEN viewing upgrade plan details THEN the system SHALL show which nodes are targeted and their upgrade status
3. WHEN upgrades complete THEN the system SHALL display success/failure status with relevant details
4. WHEN upgrades fail THEN the system SHALL show error messages and troubleshooting information
5. WHEN multiple upgrades are running THEN the system SHALL provide a consolidated view of all upgrade activities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want to configure upgrade scheduling and constraints, so that I can control when and how system upgrades are performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating upgrade plans THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of node selectors and drain options
2. WHEN setting up upgrades THEN the system SHALL support concurrency limits and upgrade windows
3. WHEN configuring plans THEN the system SHALL allow specification of pre and post upgrade scripts
4. WHEN scheduling upgrades THEN the system SHALL support both immediate and scheduled execution
5. WHEN setting constraints THEN the system SHALL validate configuration before saving

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want to view upgrade history and logs, so that I can audit past upgrades and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing upgrade history THEN the system SHALL display completed upgrades with timestamps and outcomes
2. WHEN accessing upgrade logs THEN the system SHALL show detailed execution logs for each upgrade job
3. WHEN filtering history THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date range, node, and status
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow downloading upgrade reports and logs
5. WHEN viewing details THEN the system SHALL show before/after system information where available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want to receive notifications about upgrade status, so that I can be alerted to successful completions or failures requiring attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrades complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators in the UI
2. WHEN upgrades fail THEN the system SHALL highlight failed upgrades with error details
3. WHEN viewing the overview page THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics of recent upgrade activities
4. WHEN upgrades are pending THEN the system SHALL indicate waiting or queued upgrades
5. WHEN system resources are insufficient THEN the system SHALL warn about potential upgrade issues
